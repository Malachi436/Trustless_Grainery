LOGIN CREDENTIALS:

Owner App:
  Phone: 0201234567
  PIN: 5678

MOBILE CONNECTIVITY:

Your IP is set to: 172.20.10.3:8081
Backend will be reached at: http://172.20.10.3:4000

If you need to change the IP:
  Edit: frontend/src/lib/api-config.ts
  Change: const STATIC_IP = '172.20.10.3';

---

TROUBLESHOOTING:

If the app won't connect:
  1. Check backend is running (Terminal 1)
  2. Verify your machine IP: ipconfig (look for IPv4 Address)
  3. Update STATIC_IP in api-config.ts
  4. Restart mobile frontend (npm start)

If ports are already in use:
  - Backend: kill process on 4000
  - Owner Dashboard: kill process on 3000
  - Admin Dashboard: kill process on 3001

THAT'S IT! One command, one QR scan, you're done.
